Python uses the print() function to display output to the console.
Example: print("Hello, world!")

The def keyword is used to define a function in Python.
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, tuple, or string.
Example: for i in range(5): print(i)

A while loop runs as long as a given condition is true.
Example: while x < 10: x += 1

Python uses indentation (typically 4 spaces) to define blocks of code instead of braces.

Comments in Python start with the # symbol.
They are used to explain the code and are not executed.

Variables are created by assigning a value using the = operator.
Example: age = 25

The input() function allows users to enter data from the keyboard.

The int(), str(), and float() functions are used for type conversion in Python.

Lists are ordered, mutable collections of items.
Example: my_list = [1, 2, 3]

Tuples are ordered, immutable collections.
Example: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.
Example: student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 21}

Use the if-elif-else structure for conditional logic.

The len() function returns the number of items in a list, string, or dictionary.

Use import to bring in external modules.
Example: import math

The try-except block is used to handle exceptions and errors gracefully.

Strings in Python can be enclosed in single (' ') or double (" ") quotes.

You can concatenate strings using the + operator.
Example: greeting = "Hello" + " " + "World"
